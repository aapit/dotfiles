This configuration is mostly geared towards my workhorse laptop,
running Xmonad with Ubuntu 20.04 as Linux backend.
I lean heavily towards console-based tools where possible.
This enables me to:
- Customize UI to suit my keyboard-driven workflow
- Integrate tools and services
- Minimize any distractions in the GUI and workflow


These are always evolving and should be compatible with recent packages.
Feel free to use and modify as you see fit.
