My configuration is mostly geared towards my workhorse laptop, running
Xmonad with Ubuntu 20.04 as Linux backend.
I lean heavily towards console-based tools where possible,
in combination with Emacs and Vim.

These are always evolving and should be compatible with recent packages.
Feel free to use and modify as you see fit.
