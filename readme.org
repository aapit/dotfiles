This configuration is mostly geared towards Arch / Manjaro with KDE.
I also use it to provision a cloud-based, persistent VM to preserve parity between environments.
I lean heavily towards console-based tools where possible.
This enables me to:
- Customize UI to suit my keyboard-driven workflow
- Integrate tools and services
- Minimize any distractions in the GUI and workflow


These are always evolving and should be compatible with recent packages.
Feel free to use and modify as you see fit.
